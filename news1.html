    <h1 class='title'>Third Patch (v1.1.0) (fixes the Centerline Issue)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-05</h2>
    <p>As reported before, the Mission Generator used to report incorrect
    centerline deviations for certain third-party sceneries, and would
    never show some sceneries as mission destinations.</p>
    <p>Both of these issues were due to X-Plane not giving plugins
    information about runways, which meant that the Mission Generator used
    its own runway database that I created offline from X-Plane's apt.dat.</p>
    <p>Of course, this database would not show any changed runway layouts or
    added runways from third-party sceneries, or X-Plane's own global
    airport updates.</p>
    <p>As of v1.1.0, the Mission Generator intelligently reads your installed
    sceneries, and builds a new runway database every time you install a
    new scenery. The process can take a few seconds to finish, but it is
    only run if your scenery changes. If you think it might not have
    picked up on a new scenery, you can also start the rebuild manually
    from the menu bar.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Fixes debriefing issue (thank you, shaja, for finding and <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/159020-not-recognizing-completed-missions/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=1495812">fixing</a> it!)</li>

    <h1 class='title'>That Centerline Issue</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-01</h2>
    <p>Some people are seeing an issue where the Takeoff centerline deviation
    and landing centerline deviation are wildly off. This is caused by
    add-on airports, or an updated apt.dat, which moved the runway
    locations.</p>
    <p>Since X-Plane does not give plugins information about the locations of
    runways, the Mission Generator has its own database of runway locations,
    derived from X-Plane's default apt.dat. Thus, if an add-on moves the
    runway locations, the Mission Generator won't know about it, and will
    assume you landed in the wheeds.</p>
    <p>To fix this, I will add a new menu option to rebuild the scenery
    database in a future update. But this is a bigger undertaking, and will
    take a few days.</p>
    <p>As a nice side benefit, this will make completely new add-on airports
    available as mission targets as well.</p>

  <section class='post'>
    <h1 class='title'>First Patch</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-09-30</h2>
    <p>I just uploaded a quick bug fix for the most important issues in the
    release. This bug fix release contains:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Corrected payload generation (should no longer try to cram ten 20kg
      people into a five-seat aircraft)</li>
    <li>Take-offs from non-default add-on airports no longer messes up the
      Mission Generator.</li>
    <li>Adds some logging, which should make debugging easier in case you find
      more problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is still a known issue with add-on airports that change the runway
    layout of default airports. In this case, you might get an incorrect
    landing centerline deviation. I am working to fix that, but it is a
    major undertaking which will take a while.</p>
    <p>If you find more bugs, please post them to the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/forum/430-mission-generator/">Mission Generator forum
