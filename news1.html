    <h1 class='title'>Fourth Patch (v1.1.1)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-08</h2>
    <p>The last patch (v1.1.0) added the ability to rebuild the Mission
    Generator's scenery database from the actual sceneries' apt.dat files.
    While this fixed many issues, some people had add-on sceneries with
    incorrectly formatted apt.dat files, which tripped up the database
    crawler.</p>
    <p>The resulting incomplete scenery database lead to empty mission lists or
    even freezes when opening the mission list (if you had one of those
    malformed sceneries). As always, this problem did not happen on my
    machine, since none of my sceneries had these problems.</p>
    <p>Thus, I now added some scenery validation code which should prevent
    malformed apt.dat files from messing up the whole scenery database.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the patch fixes a bunch of smaller issues, such as payload
    issues, mission distance issues, and more mission templates. And I have
    a new theory on why the centerline deviation is sometimes way off: It
    might be because the Mission Generator interprets taxiing too fast as
    part of the takeoff roll. If you experience the centerline issue, try
    taxiing slower than 30 km/h (15 kt).</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Third Patch (v1.1.0) (fixes the Centerline Issue)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-05</h2>
    <p>As reported before, the Mission Generator used to report incorrect
    centerline deviations for certain third-party sceneries, and would
    never show some sceneries as mission destinations.</p>
    <p>Both of these issues were due to X-Plane not giving plugins
    information about runways, which meant that the Mission Generator used
    its own runway database that I created offline from X-Plane's apt.dat.</p>
    <p>Of course, this database would not show any changed runway layouts or
    added runways from third-party sceneries, or X-Plane's own global
    airport updates.</p>
    <p>As of v1.1.0, the Mission Generator intelligently reads your installed
    sceneries, and builds a new runway database every time you install a
    new scenery. The process can take a few seconds to finish, but it is
    only run if your scenery changes. If you think it might not have
    picked up on a new scenery, you can also start the rebuild manually
    from the menu bar.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Second Patch (v1.0.2)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-01</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixes debriefing issue (thank you, shaja, for finding and <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/159020-not-recognizing-completed-missions/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=1495812">fixing</a> it!)</li>

    <h1 class='title'>That Centerline Issue</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-01</h2>
    <p>Some people are seeing an issue where the Takeoff centerline deviation
    and landing centerline deviation are wildly off. This is caused by
    add-on airports, or an updated apt.dat, which moved the runway
    locations.</p>
    <p>Since X-Plane does not give plugins information about the locations of
    runways, the Mission Generator has its own database of runway locations,
    derived from X-Plane's default apt.dat. Thus, if an add-on moves the
    runway locations, the Mission Generator won't know about it, and will
    assume you landed in the wheeds.</p>
    <p>To fix this, I will add a new menu option to rebuild the scenery
    database in a future update. But this is a bigger undertaking, and will
    take a few days.</p>
    <p>As a nice side benefit, this will make completely new add-on airports
    available as mission targets as well.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>First Patch</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-09-30</h2>
    <p>I just uploaded a quick bug fix for the most important issues in the
    release. This bug fix release contains:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Corrected payload generation (should no longer try to cram ten 20kg
      people into a five-seat aircraft)</li>
    <li>Take-offs from non-default add-on airports no longer messes up the
      Mission Generator.</li>
    <li>Adds some logging, which should make debugging easier in case you find
      more problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is still a known issue with add-on airports that change the runway
    layout of default airports. In this case, you might get an incorrect
    landing centerline deviation. I am working to fix that, but it is a
    major undertaking which will take a while.</p>
    <p>If you find more bugs, please post them to the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/forum/430-mission-generator/">Mission Generator forum
