    <h1 class='title'>Eighth Patch (v1.3.1)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2019-03-31</h2>
    <p>This is a bugfix update for an issue introduced in v1.2.0, which missed
    a conversion between knots and kilometers per hour in the cruise speed
    estimation code. I am very sorry about that.</p>
    <p>This also applies to cruise speeds in <code>missiongenerator_overrides.lua</code>,
    which were read as knots, so if you had one of those, you should check
    that they still work correctly.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Seventh Patch (v1.3.0)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2019-02-27</h2>
    <p>Up until now, the Mission Generator treated every airport equally.
    Large or small, 2D or 3D, the Mission Generator didn't know the
    difference. This now changes. With this patch, the Mission Generator
    now has some limited knowledge about where a scenery came from,
    according to the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the scenery is part of the base X-Plane scenery, it is a "2D"
      scenery.</li>
    <li>If the scenery is part of the "Global Airports" custom scenery, it a
      "3D" scenery. These are the Scenery Gateway, "Lego-Brick"
      sceneries.</li>
    <li>If the scenery is anything else, it is a "Add-On" scenery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is now displayed in the mission briefing, so you have
    a better idea where you are going. Even better, the Mission Generator
    now subtly prefers Add-On sceneries over 3D sceneries over 2D
    sceneries. This should make for more interesting missions!</p>
    <p>This patch also introduces three new entries in <em>settings.lua</em> for
    tweaking these chances. However, be aware that this does come with a
    few caveats:<br />
    Firstly, the Mission Generator can only generate missions to existing
    airports, picked at random from the surrounding area. So if there are
    no 3D or Add-On sceneries available in a region, lowering the chances
    for 2D sceneries will simply reduce the number of
    available missions.<br />
    Secondly, not every "Global Airports"-Lego-Brick scenery does actually
    include 3D objects.<br />
    So treat these settings with care. Extreme values are probably not
    what you want.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Sixth Patch (v1.2.0)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2019-01-05</h2>
    <p>It's been a while, hasn't it? The last time you heard from me was in
    October. I developed the Mission Generator during paternity leave.
    When I got back to work, I didn't have nearly as much time available
    to keep working on things in my spare time. But that doesn't mean I
    have forgotten about the Mission Generator, just that the pace of
    updates can't be as fast now as it was in the beginning.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, it seems that the Mission Generator is actually working
    well for most people! As a result, this update will probably not
    change anything for the majority of users, but fix a few niggling
    issues for some:</p>
    <p>A recurring theme in bug reports is that the Mission Generator
    sometimes appears to not know the payload capacity, cruise speed, and
    landing distance of some aircrafts. And in fact, this is exactly true:
    X-Plane simply does not expose this kind of information to plugins.
    Instead, the Mission Generator takes an educated guess, based on the
    available data. And usually, the estimate is pretty accurate, as
    estimates go. But of course, some aircraft with unusual combinations
    of performance numbers are bound to lead to inaccurate estimates.</p>
    <p>And there is really nothing the Mission Generator can do about it
    internally. So instead, it now creates a file
    <code>missiongenerator_overrides.lua</code> in every aircraft's
    directory, where you can override the Mission Generator's estimate
    manually. In this file, you can specify your own cruise speed, payload
    capacity, and minimum landing distance for every aircraft, and
    customize it to your liking.</p>
    <p>On the same note, due to the variability in guessing the cruise speed,
    urgent missions actually were impossible to complete in some aircraft.
    To improve this, the speed requirements for urgent missions were
    slightly lessened.</p>
    <p>And finally, one user pointed me to a rare issue with some third-party
    sceneries with unusual apt.dat formatting that lead to "not at
    starting point" errors in the mission briefing. This has been fixed.</p>
    <p>However, there is still that one bug that keeps eluding me: A small
    number of people sometimes get "no landing" or "no takeoff" messages
    in their debriefing. From what I can tell, this error usually goes
    away if they rebuild their X-Plane install, and seems to happen more
    often for small aircraft than for larger ones. But I have not yet been
    able to reproduce this issue myself, and hence don't know yet what
    causes it.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Fifth Patch (v1.1.2)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-20</h2>
    <p>It seems that all major issues have actually been resolved as of the
    previous version. Thus, I can now finally focus on refining the
    experience, and start tackling subtler issues and preferences. This
    patch is full of small improvements that don't change the game, but
    should make for a smoother experience.</p>
    <p>For example, there was an interesting issue with helicopters: When a
    helicopter touches down, it immediately finishes the current mission
    and unloads the payload. Normally, this is not an problem. But in
    <em>some</em> cases, with particularly heavy payloads and particularly smooth
    touch downs, taking off the payload would make the helicopter light
    enough to float up again! So with v1.1.2, helicopter missions will
    only finish once touched down <em>and</em> the collective is reduced (see
    settings.lua for the particular threshold).</p>
    <p>Another issue were taxi speeds and cruise speeds. The centerline
    deviation is only calculated if the aircraft is moving faster than the
    taxi speed, but a perfectly reasonable taxi speed for a passenger jet
    will be far beyond the takeoff speed of small ultralights. So now the
    taxi speed is determined either by a minimum of 30 km/h, or a quarter
    of the stall speed, whichever is higher (Again, adjustable in
    settings.lua). Similarly, the cruise speed is now the mean of the
    maneuvering speed and top speed (center of the yellow arc), which is
    probably conservative for turbine-powered aircraft, and a bit too fast
    for piston aircraft, but in any case much better than before.</p>
    <p>A third issue was a real head-scratcher: Sometimes, some X-Plane
    datarefs would apparently contain invalid data. This seems to happen
    randomly, but more often at very low frame rates (which I don't run)
    and in conjunction with a lot of other plugins (which I don't use). As
    such, I could never reproduce these issues. The root cause is probably
    a bug in SASL or X-Plane, and not under my control. And in any case,
    most of the time, these little hickups would not matter much, and
    merely cause a transient error in the X-Plane log or a short flicker
    on the briefing screen. But <em>sometimes</em>, in very rare cases, they
    would block mission progress, or prevent mission success. I have added
    workarounds for these cases, which will hopefully make them
    unproblematic.</p>
    <p>And finally, there are of course a number of additional bug fixes,
    like fixes for the payload name generation, time formatting in the
    briefing and debriefing, overly-unreliable missions, and a renamed
    menu item.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Fourth Patch (v1.1.1)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2018-10-08</h2>
    <p>The last patch (v1.1.0) added the ability to rebuild the Mission
    Generator's scenery database from the actual sceneries' apt.dat files.
    While this fixed many issues, some people had add-on sceneries with
    incorrectly formatted apt.dat files, which tripped up the database
    crawler.</p>
    <p>The resulting incomplete scenery database lead to empty mission lists or
    even freezes when opening the mission list (if you had one of those
    malformed sceneries). As always, this problem did not happen on my
    machine, since none of my sceneries had these problems.</p>
    <p>Thus, I now added some scenery validation code which should prevent
    malformed apt.dat files from messing up the whole scenery database.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the patch fixes a bunch of smaller issues, such as payload
    issues, mission distance issues, and more mission templates. And I have
    a new theory on why the centerline deviation is sometimes way off: It
    might be because the Mission Generator interprets taxiing too fast as
    part of the takeoff roll. If you experience the centerline issue, try
    taxiing slower than 30 km/h (15 kt).</p>
