    <title>Fourteenth Patch (v1.5.1)</title>
    <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>A recent change in X-Plane's scenery database added airports without
ICAO codes, and airports with multiple codes. These airports caused the
Mission Generator to not display a mission list, or show an incomplete
mission briefing without an [accept] button.</p>
<p>With the gracious help of forum user Gary Hensley, this patch fixes
these issues.</p>

    <title>Thirteenth Patch (v1.5.0)</title>
    <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>Some users who were flying bush planes and liked to practice
short-field landings and takeoffs, sometimes encountered a bug where
the Mission Generator wasn't able to tell which runway they used. This
resulted in an <code>[unknown airport]</code> in the takeoff or landing statistic
in the debriefing. With the gracious help of the forum users petrivka
and pa4tim, this problem could finally be fixed.</p>
<p>Secondly, this update brings VR support out of beta. The VR/XP11
version is now just as beautiful as the legacy XP10 version, but with
better window management and VR support. I would now recommend all
XP11 users to upgrade to the XP11 version.</p>

    <title>Twelvth Patch (v1.4.0)</title>
    <pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>This patch is a big one: BETA VR support!</p>
<p>The Mission Generator is now available in two versions: One compatible
with XP10 and XP11, looking and behaving just as it always has. And a
new, XP11-only version, that is VR compatible. The VR version is still
a beta version, and not as pretty as the old version: It uses XP11's
new and shiny floating windows that can be popped out of XP11's main
window, and positioned on VR. The downside is, these windows currently
draw a rather big and ugly border around the Mission Generator's
windows. That's why it's still a beta version.</p>
<p>But you can now fly missions entirely in VR!</p>
<p>Also, this version fixes a bug that would sometimes corrupt the pilot
profile with NaN experience points. This should not happen again.</p>

    <title>Eleventh Patch (v1.3.4)</title>
    <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>The Mission Generator's bug tracker has been very quiet in the last
few months. But very occasionally, the mission list would not pop up
for a small number of users, and the log would show an error message
saying <code>attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'lon1' (a nil value)</code>.
But none of my computers would ever show this message, so I couldn't
investigate it.</p>
<p>However, things changed when forum user <em>Luke173</em> worked with me for
several weeks to investigate the issue as it was happening on his
computer. And with his help, we finally found a solution: On some
installations on macOS, the last entry in the landmarks database could
not be read, which lead to an error whenever a sightseeing bonus
mission was generated.</p>
<p>Today's patch fixes this issue. Many thanks to Luke173 for his help!</p>

    <title>Tenth Patch (v1.3.3)</title>
    <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2019 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>This is a bugfix release, which finally fixes the "unknown airport"
bug. Some users have experienced a bug where some or all mission
debriefings showed no bonus points, but instead an error message
saying "unknown airport". Sadly, I was never able to fix this bug as
it didn't happen on my computers.</p>
<p>Recently however, the forum user <em>Montag</em> posted a <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/164409-unknown-airports/&amp;tab=comments#comment-1731980">detailed
analysis</a>
of the problem as it happened on his computer. As it turns out, on
some computers, X-Plane would not set the "wheels are on the ground"
dataref correctly, which would trip up the Mission Generator when it
tried to calculate landing statistics etc.. This patch now uses an
altitude-above-ground check instead of the "onground" dataref, which
should fix the issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this patch fixes a few incorrect speed and distance
displays, which were caused by missing or wrong unit conversions.</p>

    <title>Nineth Patch (v1.3.2)</title>
    <pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>This release fixes a crash that happened if the Mission Generator tried
to access one of the 20 last entries in the airport database on Windows.
Thank you very much to forum user kekke2000 for helping me track down
this bug!</p>
<p>It also fixes a small inaccuracy in the cruise speed estimation, though
this was probably unnoticeable due to the general inaccuracy of those
estimates.</p>

    <title>Eighth Patch (v1.3.1)</title>
    <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2019 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>This is a bugfix update for an issue introduced in v1.2.0, which missed
a conversion between knots and kilometers per hour in the cruise speed
estimation code. I am very sorry about that.</p>
<p>This also applies to cruise speeds in <code>missiongenerator_overrides.lua</code>,
which were read as knots, so if you had one of those, you should check
that they still work correctly.</p>

    <title>Seventh Patch (v1.3.0)</title>
    <pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2019 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>Up until now, the Mission Generator treated every airport equally.
Large or small, 2D or 3D, the Mission Generator didn't know the
difference. This now changes. With this patch, the Mission Generator
now has some limited knowledge about where a scenery came from,
according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the scenery is part of the base X-Plane scenery, it is a "2D"
  scenery.</li>
<li>If the scenery is part of the "Global Airports" custom scenery, it a
  "3D" scenery. These are the Scenery Gateway, "Lego-Brick"
  sceneries.</li>
<li>If the scenery is anything else, it is a "Add-On" scenery.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is now displayed in the mission briefing, so you have
a better idea where you are going. Even better, the Mission Generator
now subtly prefers Add-On sceneries over 3D sceneries over 2D
sceneries. This should make for more interesting missions!</p>
<p>This patch also introduces three new entries in <em>settings.lua</em> for
tweaking these chances. However, be aware that this does come with a
few caveats:<br />
Firstly, the Mission Generator can only generate missions to existing
airports, picked at random from the surrounding area. So if there are
no 3D or Add-On sceneries available in a region, lowering the chances
for 2D sceneries will simply reduce the number of
available missions.<br />
Secondly, not every "Global Airports"-Lego-Brick scenery does actually
include 3D objects.<br />
So treat these settings with care. Extreme values are probably not
what you want.</p>

    <title>Sixth Patch (v1.2.0)</title>
    <pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>It's been a while, hasn't it? The last time you heard from me was in
October. I developed the Mission Generator during paternity leave.
When I got back to work, I didn't have nearly as much time available
to keep working on things in my spare time. But that doesn't mean I
have forgotten about the Mission Generator, just that the pace of
updates can't be as fast now as it was in the beginning.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems that the Mission Generator is actually working
well for most people! As a result, this update will probably not
change anything for the majority of users, but fix a few niggling
issues for some:</p>
<p>A recurring theme in bug reports is that the Mission Generator
sometimes appears to not know the payload capacity, cruise speed, and
landing distance of some aircrafts. And in fact, this is exactly true:
X-Plane simply does not expose this kind of information to plugins.
Instead, the Mission Generator takes an educated guess, based on the
available data. And usually, the estimate is pretty accurate, as
estimates go. But of course, some aircraft with unusual combinations
of performance numbers are bound to lead to inaccurate estimates.</p>
<p>And there is really nothing the Mission Generator can do about it
internally. So instead, it now creates a file
<code>missiongenerator_overrides.lua</code> in every aircraft's
directory, where you can override the Mission Generator's estimate
manually. In this file, you can specify your own cruise speed, payload
capacity, and minimum landing distance for every aircraft, and
customize it to your liking.</p>
<p>On the same note, due to the variability in guessing the cruise speed,
urgent missions actually were impossible to complete in some aircraft.
To improve this, the speed requirements for urgent missions were
slightly lessened.</p>
<p>And finally, one user pointed me to a rare issue with some third-party
sceneries with unusual apt.dat formatting that lead to "not at
starting point" errors in the mission briefing. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>However, there is still that one bug that keeps eluding me: A small
number of people sometimes get "no landing" or "no takeoff" messages
in their debriefing. From what I can tell, this error usually goes
away if they rebuild their X-Plane install, and seems to happen more
often for small aircraft than for larger ones. But I have not yet been
able to reproduce this issue myself, and hence don't know yet what
causes it.</p>

    <title>Fifth Patch (v1.1.2)</title>
    <pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>It seems that all major issues have actually been resolved as of the
previous version. Thus, I can now finally focus on refining the
experience, and start tackling subtler issues and preferences. This
patch is full of small improvements that don't change the game, but
should make for a smoother experience.</p>
<p>For example, there was an interesting issue with helicopters: When a
helicopter touches down, it immediately finishes the current mission
and unloads the payload. Normally, this is not an problem. But in
<em>some</em> cases, with particularly heavy payloads and particularly smooth
touch downs, taking off the payload would make the helicopter light
enough to float up again! So with v1.1.2, helicopter missions will
only finish once touched down <em>and</em> the collective is reduced (see
settings.lua for the particular threshold).</p>
<p>Another issue were taxi speeds and cruise speeds. The centerline
deviation is only calculated if the aircraft is moving faster than the
taxi speed, but a perfectly reasonable taxi speed for a passenger jet
will be far beyond the takeoff speed of small ultralights. So now the
taxi speed is determined either by a minimum of 30 km/h, or a quarter
of the stall speed, whichever is higher (Again, adjustable in
settings.lua). Similarly, the cruise speed is now the mean of the
maneuvering speed and top speed (center of the yellow arc), which is
probably conservative for turbine-powered aircraft, and a bit too fast
for piston aircraft, but in any case much better than before.</p>
<p>A third issue was a real head-scratcher: Sometimes, some X-Plane
datarefs would apparently contain invalid data. This seems to happen
randomly, but more often at very low frame rates (which I don't run)
and in conjunction with a lot of other plugins (which I don't use). As
such, I could never reproduce these issues. The root cause is probably
a bug in SASL or X-Plane, and not under my control. And in any case,
most of the time, these little hickups would not matter much, and
merely cause a transient error in the X-Plane log or a short flicker
on the briefing screen. But <em>sometimes</em>, in very rare cases, they
would block mission progress, or prevent mission success. I have added
workarounds for these cases, which will hopefully make them
unproblematic.</p>
<p>And finally, there are of course a number of additional bug fixes,
like fixes for the payload name generation, time formatting in the
briefing and debriefing, overly-unreliable missions, and a renamed
menu item.</p>

    <title>Fourth Patch (v1.1.1)</title>
    <pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>The last patch (v1.1.0) added the ability to rebuild the Mission
Generator's scenery database from the actual sceneries' apt.dat files.
While this fixed many issues, some people had add-on sceneries with
incorrectly formatted apt.dat files, which tripped up the database
crawler.</p>
<p>The resulting incomplete scenery database lead to empty mission lists or
even freezes when opening the mission list (if you had one of those
malformed sceneries). As always, this problem did not happen on my
machine, since none of my sceneries had these problems.</p>
<p>Thus, I now added some scenery validation code which should prevent
malformed apt.dat files from messing up the whole scenery database.</p>
<p>Additionally, the patch fixes a bunch of smaller issues, such as payload
issues, mission distance issues, and more mission templates. And I have
a new theory on why the centerline deviation is sometimes way off: It
might be because the Mission Generator interprets taxiing too fast as
part of the takeoff roll. If you experience the centerline issue, try
taxiing slower than 30 km/h (15 kt).</p>

    <title>Third Patch (v1.1.0) (fixes the Centerline Issue)</title>
    <pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>As reported before, the Mission Generator used to report incorrect
centerline deviations for certain third-party sceneries, and would
never show some sceneries as mission destinations.</p>
<p>Both of these issues were due to X-Plane not giving plugins
information about runways, which meant that the Mission Generator used
its own runway database that I created offline from X-Plane's apt.dat.</p>
<p>Of course, this database would not show any changed runway layouts or
added runways from third-party sceneries, or X-Plane's own global
airport updates.</p>
<p>As of v1.1.0, the Mission Generator intelligently reads your installed
sceneries, and builds a new runway database every time you install a
new scenery. The process can take a few seconds to finish, but it is
only run if your scenery changes. If you think it might not have
picked up on a new scenery, you can also start the rebuild manually
from the menu bar.</p>

    <title>That Centerline Issue</title>
    <pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>Some people are seeing an issue where the Takeoff centerline deviation
and landing centerline deviation are wildly off. This is caused by
add-on airports, or an updated apt.dat, which moved the runway
locations.</p>
<p>Since X-Plane does not give plugins information about the locations of
runways, the Mission Generator has its own database of runway locations,
derived from X-Plane's default apt.dat. Thus, if an add-on moves the
runway locations, the Mission Generator won't know about it, and will
assume you landed in the wheeds.</p>
<p>To fix this, I will add a new menu option to rebuild the scenery
database in a future update. But this is a bigger undertaking, and will
take a few days.</p>
<p>As a nice side benefit, this will make completely new add-on airports
available as mission targets as well.</p>

    <title>First Patch</title>
    <pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>I just uploaded a quick bug fix for the most important issues in the
release. This bug fix release contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected payload generation (should no longer try to cram ten 20kg
  people into a five-seat aircraft)</li>
<li>Take-offs from non-default add-on airports no longer messes up the
  Mission Generator.</li>
<li>Adds some logging, which should make debugging easier in case you find
  more problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is still a known issue with add-on airports that change the runway
layout of default airports. In this case, you might get an incorrect
landing centerline deviation. I am working to fix that, but it is a
major undertaking which will take a while.</p>

    <title>The code</title>
    <pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:00:00 </pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[
<p>The last few days I spent cleaning up the Mission Generator's code, and
documenting it thoroughly. One could argue that no-one will look at the
code of an X-Plane plugin, anyway, so why document it?</p>
<p>But I plan that the initial release of the Mission Generator will only
the first step in a long development. Which means that I will work with
this code for a long time. Spending some effort now to help future me,
who will have forgotten half the intricacies of the Mission Generator,
is time well spent.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I hope that other people will look at the code, and try
to improve things. While the Mission Generator is a commercial piece of
software, I give every user express permission to publish improved
versions of a few key files. This might, for example, include more
varied bonus missions, or more mission templates, or re-balanced
versions of the level ups.</p>
<p>I also hope that the Mission Generator will encourage people to develop
their own plugins. As it turns out, writing plugins for X-Plane is not
hard (if you know programming). There are a lot of intricate and
interesting algorithms in the Mission Generator, and all of them are now
well-documented for intrepid readers.</p>
<p>And of course, old habits die hard. I always try to maintain as good a
code quality as I can in <a href="https://github.com/bastibe">my programming projects</a>.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>As far as I can tell, all major bugs in the Mission Generator have now
been fixed. Now, all that remains is to get this website up and
running, and getting the plugin listed on the X-Plane.org Store.</p>
