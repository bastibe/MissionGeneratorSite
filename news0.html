    <h1 class='title'>Thirteenth Patch (v1.5.0)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2020-07-30</h2>
    <p>Some users who were flying bush planes and liked to practice
    short-field landings and takeoffs, sometimes encountered a bug where
    the Mission Generator wasn't able to tell which runway they used. This
    resulted in an <code>[unknown airport]</code> in the takeoff or landing statistic
    in the debriefing. With the gracious help of the forum users petrivka
    and pa4tim, this problem could finally be fixed.</p>
    <p>Secondly, this update brings VR support out of beta. The VR/XP11
    version is now just as beautiful as the legacy XP10 version, but with
    better window management and VR support. I would now recommend all
    XP11 users to upgrade to the XP11 version.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Twelvth Patch (v1.4.0)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2020-04-19</h2>
    <p>This patch is a big one: BETA VR support!</p>
    <p>The Mission Generator is now available in two versions: One compatible
    with XP10 and XP11, looking and behaving just as it always has. And a
    new, XP11-only version, that is VR compatible. The VR version is still
    a beta version, and not as pretty as the old version: It uses XP11's
    new and shiny floating windows that can be popped out of XP11's main
    window, and positioned on VR. The downside is, these windows currently
    draw a rather big and ugly border around the Mission Generator's
    windows. That's why it's still a beta version.</p>
    <p>But you can now fly missions entirely in VR!</p>
    <p>Also, this version fixes a bug that would sometimes corrupt the pilot
    profile with NaN experience points. This should not happen again.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Eleventh Patch (v1.3.4)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2020-01-26</h2>
    <p>The Mission Generator's bug tracker has been very quiet in the last
    few months. But very occasionally, the mission list would not pop up
    for a small number of users, and the log would show an error message
    saying <code>attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'lon1' (a nil value)</code>.
    But none of my computers would ever show this message, so I couldn't
    investigate it.</p>
    <p>However, things changed when forum user <em>Luke173</em> worked with me for
    several weeks to investigate the issue as it was happening on his
    computer. And with his help, we finally found a solution: On some
    installations on macOS, the last entry in the landmarks database could
    not be read, which lead to an error whenever a sightseeing bonus
    mission was generated.</p>
    <p>Today's patch fixes this issue. Many thanks to Luke173 for his help!</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Tenth Patch (v1.3.3)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2019-09-07</h2>
    <p>This is a bugfix release, which finally fixes the "unknown airport"
    bug. Some users have experienced a bug where some or all mission
    debriefings showed no bonus points, but instead an error message
    saying "unknown airport". Sadly, I was never able to fix this bug as
    it didn't happen on my computers.</p>
    <p>Recently however, the forum user <em>Montag</em> posted a <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/164409-unknown-airports/&amp;tab=comments#comment-1731980">detailed
    analysis</a>
    of the problem as it happened on his computer. As it turns out, on
    some computers, X-Plane would not set the "wheels are on the ground"
    dataref correctly, which would trip up the Mission Generator when it
    tried to calculate landing statistics etc.. This patch now uses an
    altitude-above-ground check instead of the "onground" dataref, which
    should fix the issue.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, this patch fixes a few incorrect speed and distance
    displays, which were caused by missing or wrong unit conversions.</p>

    <h1 class='title'>Nineth Patch (v1.3.2)</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>2019-04-03</h2>
    <p>This release fixes a crash that happened if the Mission Generator tried
    to access one of the 20 last entries in the airport database on Windows.
    Thank you very much to forum user kekke2000 for helping me track down
    this bug!</p>
    <p>It also fixes a small inaccuracy in the cruise speed estimation, though
    this was probably unnoticeable due to the general inaccuracy of those
    estimates.</p>
