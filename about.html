      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Greetings!</p>
      <p>My name is Bastian Bechtold, a scientist and software
        developer from Germany, with a secret passion for science
        fiction, programming, aviation, and video games.</p>
      <p>When I was a child, my grandfather was flying ultralight
        (EASA) airplanes, and often took me on flights all across
        southern Germany. For his fiftieth birthday, someone gifted
        him a computer, and Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95.
        He didn't use it much, but to my ten-year-old self, this was a
        revelation.</p>
      <p>I lost sight of flight simulation, however, and only
        re-discovered it about ten years later, with Microsoft Flight
        Simulator 2004 and X-Plane 8. Since then, I used FSX
        extensively, some Prepar3D, and a lot of X-Plane. To my mind,
        the true genius of X-Plane is its openness as a platform that
        encourages normal people to take part in its development of
        scenery, airplanes, and plugins.</p>
      <p>However, I always missed FSX's missions. I tried FSEconomy as
        an alternative, but ultimately became disillusioned by its
        community, and insistence on punishing me for not flying as
        much as other people.</p>
      <p>After much consideration, I figured that if no-one else was
        willing to build the kind of flight simulator experience I
        wanted, I would have to do it myself. And thus, the Mission
        Generator was born.</p>
