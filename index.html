    <h1>Mission Generator</h1>
    <h2>A plugin for X-Plane</h2>
  </header>

  <section id="overview">
    <p id="introduction">You don't know where to fly? You need a motivation to climb into
      your cockpit and take off into the wild blue yonder? You yearn for
      a story to go with your flight simulator? Then the Mission
      Generator is for you! Select your favorite airplane, go to your
      favorite airport, and let the Mission Generator take you on an
      adventure!</p>
    <div class="third">
      <h1>What it is</h1>
      <p>The Mission Generator is a plugin for X-Plane 11 and 10 that
        creates missions, and rewards you for flying them. It prompts
        you to visit new places, and challenges your flying skill with
        bonus objectives.</p>
      <p>After completing a mission, you are debriefed with an
        evaluation of your take-off and landing, and earn experience
        points. With enough experience, you can level up, and customize
        missions to your preferred mode of flying.</p>
      <p>Missions are always tailored to your current aircraft and
        location, and take into account any add-on you installed. Beyond
        that, it includes a database of landmarks for sightseeing
        missions!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
      <h1>Getting it</h1>
      <p>You can buy the plugin on the X-Plane.org store. The plugin
        works in X-Plane 11 and 10, on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
      <p>You will get a zip-file containing a single directory, which
        must be installed in your <code>X-Plane\Resources\plugins\</code>
        directory. Once installed, you will see a new menu "Mission
        Generator" in your "Plugins" Menu, from which you can open the
        Mission List and change preferences.</p>
      <p>The Mission Generator is written in Lua with SASL, and is built
        to be understood and changed. If you don't like any aspect of
        the plugin, feel free to have a look at the source code, and
        change it to suit your needs!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
      <h1>What it is not</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Money. You do not earn money, there are no maintenance fees,
          and you don't have to pay for airplanes. You already have a
          stressful life, and don't need a plugin to make it worse.</li>
        <li>FSX. There is no voice-over, no custom scenery, and no
          changing of mission objectives after take-off. Instead, you
          get an infinite number of randomly generated missions for
          every scenery and airplane you install.</li>
        <li>Punishment. The Mission Generator will never punish you for
          what you do. You can cancel missions at any time, and still
          get some experience points. You can mess up a landing, and
          still get rewards.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="half">
      <p>Load an aircraft, select an airport, set your weather, then
        open the <em>Mission List</em>. Each mission is created for your
        current aircraft and the current airport, and tailored to the
        level ups you selected with your experience points.</p>
      <p>Missions are generated deterministically once per day, so you
        can restart X-Plane without losing your current missions.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="sidebyside">
    <div class="half">
      <p>Click a mission, and you get a <em>Mission Briefing</em>. Each
        briefing gives you a short description of what the mission is
        all about, where you need to go, and some information on the
        destination airport.</p>
      <p>The mission text is randomly generated from a set of templates.
        If you would like to add your own templates, you can do so by
        editing one simple text file.</p>
      <p>The Mission Generator reads the current weather and scenery to
        figure out whether the mission is VFR or IFR, whether the
        scenery around the airports is mountainous or coastal, and
        whether the runways are suitable for your current aircraft. All
        of these data will determine the amount of experience points you
        get for a mission.</p>
    </div>

  </section>
  <section class="sidebyside">
    <img src="special missions.png"/>
    <div class="half">
      <p>Some missions will have a <em>Bonus Objective</em> that gives bonus
        experience points, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low flight, stay below a certain altitude,</li>
        <li>Fast flight, reach your destination before a timer runs out,</li>
        <li>Fragile flight, take-off and land smoothly or break your cargo,</li>
        <li>Unreliable flight, where something might go wrong in mid-flight,</li>
        <li>Sightseeing, show your passengers a nearby landmark before landing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="sidebyside">
    <div class="half">
      <p>Once you complete your mission, you get a
        detailed <em>Debriefing</em>. This includes an evaluation of
        your take-off, your landing, the time you took to get to the
        destination, and any difficulties, like IFR conditions, severe
        wind, rain, bad runway conditions, and of course the mission
        objectives.</p>
      <p>You will also get a slight experience point reduction for using
        the auto pilot or time compression, because flying by hand is
        just more fun and challenging than having the computer do it.
        But if you don't like this, that's ok, too, and you can either
        level up your Time Compression and Autopilot skills, or disable
        these features entirely in the preferences.</p>
      <p>Of course, all your previews flights are saved in a logbook on
        your computer.</p>

    <div class="half">
      <p>Once you have gathered enough experience points, it is time to
        go to your <em>Pilot Profile</em>, and level up!</p>
      <p>You can put points in a variety of different mission
        categories, which makes these kinds of missions happen more
        frequently, and increases your rewards for doing them.</p>
      <p>If you don't like the rewards for the level-ups, all of them
        are defined in a simple text file, so you can change them to
        your liking!</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="sidebyside">
    <div class="half">
      <p>Finally, the Mission Generator includes a <em>Preferences</em>
        menu, from which you can select between metric and imperial
        units, disable the autopilot and time compression penalties, and
        select whether the debriefing appears shortly after touch down,
        or only once the parking brake has been engaged.</p>

    <h1>Change how it works</h1>
    <p>All the code that makes the Mission Generator work is written in
      simple text files that you can change to your liking. There is no
      hidden compiled code or encrypted secrets, everything is written
      in editable Lua scripts using the SASL library.</p>
    <p>In particular, here are a few files you might find useful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MissionGenerator\profile.lua</code> contains your pilot
        profile and all the level ups you spent. If you want to undo a
        few levels, or experiment with different levels, edit this
        file.</li>
      <li><code>MissionGenerator\data\modules\3rd-party\cities.csv</code>
        and <code>MissionGenerator\modules\3rd-party\mountains.csv</code>
        contain a list of all cities and mountains for sightseeing
        missions. Add your own sightseeing destinations here if you
        like.</li>
      <li><code>MissionGenerator\data\modules\3rd-party\levels.lua</code>
        contains the bonuses you get for level ups. If you like missions
        to give greater rewards, edit this file.</li>
      <li><code>MissionGenerator\data\modules\3rd-party\templates.lua</code>
        contains the template texts used to generate mission briefings.
        Edit this to create your own mission texts!</li>
      <li><code>MissionGenerator\data\modules\3rd-party\bonusmissions.lua</code>
        contains the implementation of all bonus objectives. You need to
        know a bit of programming to add your own: Create a new
        sub-class of `BonusMission`, and implement at least `start`,
        `name`, `text`, and `finish`, and append it to the list at the
        end of the file to add a new bonus mission type.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you change something that others might find useful, please
      share it back to the community. Please note that publishing your
      own versions of the whole plugin is software piracy, and not
      allowed. But, I hereby give you express permission to publish
      changed versions of the above files. Or better yet, email me at
      missiongenerator :at: mailbox :dot: org, and I might just include
      your changes in the next version of the Mission Generator!</p>
